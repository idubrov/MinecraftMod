# Palms and Sulfur

Imagine you live in the tropics, eating fruits to your heart's 
desire. You make smoothies and fruit salads, peacefully annihilating
the local banana population.  And then, you find some sulfur. You 
experiment with it, finding that you can make batteries! Although 
they are not a great fuel, (Why would you burn batteries in the first
place? Do you _want_ to die?) they are necessary for power armour [TBD].

## Features

### Palm Tree

Grow on sand. Special shape - long, angled. Drop stick and 
coconut. [Logs](docs/palm_logs.md) light taupe color. 
[Leaves](docs/palm_leaves.md) could be dried. 
Saplings.

### Sulfur Ore

All you need to know: it drops sulfur shards, it doesn't feel good on
your toes, and you can make batteries out of it. Oh yeah, mining it
with a hammer gives you sulfur powder directly.

### Hammer Tool
Use the hammer to mine sulfur ore without needing to smelt the sulfur
shards into powder, as you get the powder instantly. Who knew the 
solution to not burning coal was Stone Age technology?

### Battery
Terrible fuel (What have your parents told you about burning 
batteries?), smells _interesting_, but is needed for all electrical 
items.

### Power Armor

### New Food Recipes
Fruit salads, smoothies, and bananas! What else could you ask for? 
(Not accepting answers to question.)
