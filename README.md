# Palms and Sulfur

Imagine you live in the tropics, eating fruits to your heart's 
desire. You make smoothies and fruit salads, peacefully annihilating
the local banana population.  And then, you find some sulfur. You 
experiment with it, finding that you can make batteries! Although 
they are not a great fuel, (Why would you burn batteries in the first
place? Do you _want_ to die?) they are necessary for power armour [TBD].

## Features

[Wood](docs/palm). 
[Leaves](docs/palm).
Coconuts.

### Sulfur Ore

All you need to know: it drops [sulfur](docs/sulfur.md) shards, it doesn't feel good on
your toes, and you can make batteries out of it. Oh yeah, mining it
with a hammer gives you sulfur powder directly.

### Hammer
Use the [hammer](docs/hammer.md) to mine sulfur ore without needing to smelt the sulfur
shards into powder, as you get the powder instantly. Who knew the 
solution to not burning coal was Stone Age technology?

### Battery, Electric Tools, and Power Armor
[Batteries](docs/electric_stuff.md) make a terrible fuel (What have your parents told you about burning 
batteries?), smell _interesting_, but are needed for all electrical 
items. [Electric Tools](docs/electric_stuff.md) are faster than normal tools _and_ mine a bigger area. To make a full 
tool tier, we had to include armor, so we present to you: [Power Armor](docs/electric_stuff.md)! Completely unasked for,
ruin the balance of the game, _and_ are way too cheap! Get you Power Armor today!!!

### New Food Recipes
[Fruit salads](docs/food.md), [smoothies](docs/food.md), and more! What else could you ask for? 
(Not accepting answers to question.)
