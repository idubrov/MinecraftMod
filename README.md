# [Name TBD]Palms and Sulfur

Imagine you live in the tropics, eating fruits to your heart's 
desire. You make smoothies and fruit salads, peacefully annihilating
the local banana population.  And then, you find some sulfur. You 
experiment with it, finding that you can make batteries! Although 
they are not a great fuel, (Why would you burn batteries in the first
place? Do you _want_ to die?) they are necessary for electric tools and 
power armor.

## Features

### Palm Tree

[TBD]
Palm trees are nice and useful. They give
[wood](docs/palm), [leaves](docs/palm), and coconuts. What else could you ask for?

### Sulfur Ore

All you need to know: it drops [sulfur](docs/sulfur.md) shards, it doesn't feel good on
your toes, and you can make batteries out of it. Oh yeah, mining it
with a hammer gives you sulfur powder directly.

### Hammer
Use the [hammer](docs/hammer.md) to mine sulfur ore without needing to smelt the sulfur
shards into powder, as you get the powder instantly. Who knew the 
solution to burning less coal was Stone Age technology?

### Battery, Electric Tools, and Power Armor
[Batteries](docs/electric_stuff.md) make a terrible fuel (What have your parents told you about burning 
batteries?), smell _interesting_, but are needed for all electrical 
items. [Electric Tools](docs/electric_stuff.md) are faster than normal tools _and_ mine a bigger area. Have you ever
felt that your netherite armor doesn't protect you enough? Have you ever wanted to have a neverending regen effect?
If so, get your [Power Armor](docs/electric_stuff.md) today!

### Rice Crop and Banana Bush
Sushi! Rice pudding! Mats! All of these can be made with the rice plant! A major food source, kind of annoying to grow,
rice is essential for any self-respecting foodie! [Rice Crop](docs/plants.md), [Banana Bush](docs/plants.md)

### New Food Recipes
[Fruit salads](docs/food.md), [smoothies](docs/food.md), [sushi](docs/food.md), and more! What else could you ask for? 
(Not accepting answers to question.) 

### Electrified Effect Potion
Have you ever wanted to become a living tesla rod? Have you ever been surrounded by countless mobs? If so, the 
[electrified effect](docs/electrified_effect.md) is here to help! This effect damages you and everybody around you,
but if you wear electric armor it will absorb the electricity that damages you.
